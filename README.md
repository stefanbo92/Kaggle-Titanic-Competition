# Kaggle-Titanic-Competition

This is my approach to solve the Titanic data analysis challenge on Kaggle. For more information about the challenge have a look over here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic.


The python script will read the data from the train.csv file. After reading and displaying some of the relevant information of the dataset using the pandas library, a single hidden layer neural net will be trained on the data with tensorflow.
Finally, the the trained neural net will make predictions on the test set.

To run the script you need to install all the relevant libraries and just type 
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
python predictNN.py
```
